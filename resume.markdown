* Proposed a security model (Smart on Fhir and otherwise) for longitudinal record access interfaces with the health registries - client, provider and location - by working with BC Provincial Health Authority.
* Built (as technical manager) the Provider Location Registry (PLR). The registry is a web-service-based system that manages provider data for the Province of BC. It is the central hub within an enterprise system that consumes secure web services from external organizations using an Enterprise Service Bus and produces notifications of provider changes, sent to connected parties. The system has a web interface developed on a JEE platform that is secured by KeyCloak/OAuth. It uses health level 7 XML (HL7v3) SOAP messages, FHIR and custom RESTful/JSON messages between exposed service interfaces.

* Upgraded the Practitioner Profiles architecture and design. The legacy system consisted of a 'rats nest' of tools, systems and manual interventions. The new system, besides incorporating Ministry standards for architecture, simplified the processes, saving time and money.

* Modernized a legacy system that audited pharmacy billing to the province of BC. In addition to a basic system upgrade to a modern platform additional features included a road map to include mobile devices was included.
