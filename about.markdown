You've reached the web page of Jonathan, an experienced solution architect and health (namely [FHIR](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2019-08/ONCFHIRFSWhatIsFHIR.pdf)) standards consultant.  After working full time for many years in the engineering and health sectors it was time to form my own company.  I was feeling _bound_ by company goals and objectives as opposed to what I could offer given my experience and proclivities.

I started my education with Undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics with additional courses in physics and computer science from the University of Waterloo.  And finished my education with a Masters in Science from the University of Calgary in geomatics engineering, specializing in synthetic aperture radar remote sensing.  

My first post-Masters position was at [Novatel](https://novatel.com) working on a Global Position System simulator for testing and multi-path mitigation for European Space Agency and aviation inflight positioning.  Multi-path happens when your antenna receives the satellite signal more than once, usually due to reflecting off of surfaces in the near vicinity. 

I moved to Intermap and developed software that transferred, at high speeds, Synthetic Aperture Radar data collected during mapping flights to on-the-ground storage.  The data was used to create a gray-scale image of the earth (as _seen_ by radar wavelengths under or beside the aircraft) and a high resolution digital elevation model.  I also helped Intermap develop it's in-house image editing software that was used in a number of applications, one example being flood mapping in the UK.

At [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/en) I held a number of positions over my 17+ year tenure, too many to mention in this short summary.  I moved from a senior developer to team lead and architect.  The last 12 years of my time at CGI was primary focused on the Health sector where I was introduced and gained expertise in HL7 V3 and FHIR while working on Patient, Location and Provider Registries.  Here is a list of highlights from that time:
* rebuilt a number of legacy systems to Java and Oracle based applications
* managed an operational team tasked with keeping 70+ health (non clinical) applications running
* rebuilt the Provider Registry
* added Location to the Provider Registry
* designed and implemented FHIR interfaces for the Provider, Location and Client Registries
* gathered requirements for pharmaceutical fraud detection application and proposed new architecture 
* gathered requirements for provider fraud detection application and proposed new architecture 

Finally, I had a brief stay at [Smile Digital Health](https://www.smiledigitalhealth.com/).  Here, I extended my Health knowledge and solution architecture skills, primarily in US HealthCare, working on a FHIR project for Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina.  I was exposed to the: 
* FHIR US Core profiles, 
* U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCID), 
* the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations for providers, payers and patients, and 
* Da Vinci Project and associated implementation guides (prior authorization, health and clinical data exchange, patient and provider apis).

I've finally arrived at a great place.  Being incorporated and focusing on consulting I have more _freedom_ to pick and choose a career path that supports my goals; I am passionate about improving healthcare and I love designing and building systems.
